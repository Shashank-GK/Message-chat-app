This is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It enables real-time messaging between users, providing a seamless and interactive chat experience. The project includes both frontend and backend components, with the frontend built using React for dynamic user interfaces, and the backend powered by Node.js and Express for handling server-side operations and MongoDB for data storage.
